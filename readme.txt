The files in this directory provide input/output routines for lab 1.

There is javadoc documentation in the doc directory. Read the javadoc
to understand how the four classes work. For the simple reflex agent,
you'll want to use RoverSampleSensor; for the reflex agent with state
you'll want to use MovingRoverSensors.

You can test out the classes using:

java RoverSampleSensor -file <FILENAME_FROM_PART1>

java MovingRoverSensors -file <FILENAME_FROM_PART2>

Look at the main function in the .java files to see how these classes
are used.
